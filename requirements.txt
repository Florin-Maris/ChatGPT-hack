1. Create a one webpage game with a 10x10 grid.
    1.a Add a start game button, make it green
    1.b Add a stop game button, make it red
    1.c Hide grid when stopping game and show grid when starting game
    1.d Index grid positions by rows and columns
2. Add one plane to the grid consisting of a cockpit, a tail, a body, and two wings. The wings will occupy 5 cells in total, the cockpit will be a triangle occupying one cell, the body will occupy one cell, and the tail will occupy three cells. 3. The plane should be randomly positioned on the grid when the game starts, and the position should change each time the game is played.
4. The page knows which are the cells occupied by the plane, but they will not be visible to the user.
5. The user keeps seeing empty cells.
6. When the user clicks on a cell, check if the cell contains a part of the plane. If it does, reveal the plane part to the user by highlighting the cell.
7. The user should have 5 minutes to identify all the cells occupied by the plane parts before time elapses.
8. When the time elapses, display a message saying "time elapsed".
9. If the user identifies all the cells occupied by the plane parts before time elapses, display a random quote from a 007 movie that includes the keyword "plane". 10. Optional,  create a simple intro page with at least a button with the text START,  with an airplane background image
