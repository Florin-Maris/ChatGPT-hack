# ChatGPT-hack

Used ChatGPT even to generate the folder structure 

This script will create a folder named battleplanes in your current working directory, and then create all the necessary folders and files inside it according to the folder structure I provided earlier.

To use this script, simply copy and paste the code into a file named create-game.sh, for example, and then run the script from the command line using the following command:

```./create-game.sh```

Note: Make sure you have permission to execute the script by running chmod +x create-game.sh before running the above command.
